Security group of Server1:
inbound                      port
server2                      5044

Security group of Server2 :
outbound                  port
server1                   5044

Along with this we need to allow port 5044 in server 1 so that traffic from server 2 will be allowed to get in server 1 in port 5044
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5044/tcp
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
